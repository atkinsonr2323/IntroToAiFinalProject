# Information and Instructions

    The following game allows you to try 5 different options.
    1. Play a game against the AI
    2. Watch the AI play against the AI
    3. Benchmark a game against the AI
    4. Benchmark a game AI vs AI
    5. have the Ai go against randomly selected moves

    There are 3 different types of AI
    1. Simple: Focuses on blocking any 3 in a rows of the enemy color. 
    2. Block: Focuses on blocking the enemy player as early as possible (2's and 3's in a row)
    3. Location: Focuses on placing pieces in center (more favorable) slots when blocking opponents

    In the main code file exists a DEPTH_LEVEL attribute. We reccommend playing at a Depth level no
    higher than 6 for the game to play at a reasonable time. (6 Will still be slow for Location and
    Block AI)

    When launching the game, you will be guided by the termnal on what options you can make/choose 
    while starting and playing a game. After a game is finished the program must be re-run to play again.
    For any information on the data collection system we had for our results. Check out the Results PDF
